## Its now a time to start a blog.
This will be dev relating, personal and investment journey to share with you and the rest of community. 

Previously I have helped people develop websites and blogs powered on Sharepoint, Sitecore, Wordpress etc. There are ton of providers and its a jungle out there. 

Personally, I would like to keep this simple, no code solution and make use of the platform that I use almost every day. 

The Github pages solution, it uses _[Jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)_ to generate static site on GitHub.io

So let the journey begin :)
