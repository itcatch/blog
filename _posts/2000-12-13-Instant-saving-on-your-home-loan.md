## Instant saving on your home loan  
With Australia's record low interest rate at a **0.25%**. This is really bad news for people who have savings in the bank. However, if you have a home loan/mortgage, it might be worth reviewing it right now if you are on a *variable* terms.  
  
I have a reminder set up to do a **loan review**, and now is a good time to get your finance sorted before Christmas and ready for the New Year.  
  
Here is my run sheet:  
1. Knowing what you are paying.  
2. Browse and see what they are advertising or offering from other financial institutions.  
3. Call and tell the bank you want to do a loan review.  
4. Expecting them to reduce or match if you are paying a higher variable rate.  
5. (optional) Refinance to other banking institutions when there is a bigger saving.  
  
I have managed to call up my lender and successfully reduced interest rate from 2.59% to 2.20%, this means an instant saving of ~$20 on every $100,000 I borrowed for a 30 years loan with [MoneySmart Mortgage Calculator](https://moneysmart.gov.au/home-loans/mortgage-calculator).  
  
Unless there are more competitive offers out there provided by other financial institutions or provide incentives such as cash-back after you switch. I'm happy with this result.  
  
So what is holding you back? start calling your bank and you might be surprised on what they can offer.
